category: data

AI/Machine-Learning Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) are at the heart of many major image classification systems. I found a great blog on FreeCodeCamp by Anne Bonner (links are below). 
●	She has complete installation instructions, and a block by block explanation of the python code required to built the model using PyTorch. 
●	I landed up using Google Collab that gives you a free GPU. How cool! 
●	She provides a brief explanation of the pre-trained models like ResNet and DenseNet that can be used for “Transfer Learning”. 
●	She has also shared some github links with the code. 
●	I was able to build a model and test it.
