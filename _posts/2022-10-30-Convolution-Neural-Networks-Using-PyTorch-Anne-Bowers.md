AI/Machine-Learning Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) are at the heart of many major image classification systems. I found a great blog on FreeCodeCamp (links are below). <br>
+	She has complete installation instructions, and a block by block explanation of the python code required to built the model using PyTorch. <br>
+	I landed up using Google Collab that gives you a free GPU. How cool! <br>
+	She provides a brief explanation of the pre-trained models like ResNet and DenseNet that can be used for “Transfer Learning”. <br>
+	She has also shared some github links with the code. <br>
+	I was able to build a model and test it. <br>
