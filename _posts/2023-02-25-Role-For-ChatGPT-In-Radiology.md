Amazing Podacat! The panel discusses the the ability of ChatGPT to be reasonably good at a variety of tasks like creating paragraphs for medical writing, cancer subtype label extraction from radiology reports and generating code for academic teaching! There's even an example of ChatGPT creating content to submit for healthcare insurance billing purposes. It seems that we are just at the beginning of the creativity cycle of what we can do!
