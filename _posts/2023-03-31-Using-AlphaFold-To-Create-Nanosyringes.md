The research team used a newly released version of artificial intelligence software called AlphaFold (DeepMind/Google). AlphaFold predicts the three-dimensional structure of proteins from sequences of amino acids. A 3-D view of a tail fiber protein helped the team figure out how to alter it so that it would reliably attach to human cells. 

In one experiment, the team was able to make the nanosyringes with altered tail fibers stick to an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that sits on the surface of some human cancer cells. Loading the injection system with a toxin killed nearly all the cells bearing the receptor but did not harm other cells, illustrating its specificity.
