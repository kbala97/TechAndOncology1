title:  "The End of the Beginning"
---

This book is about the stunning recent success with immune oncology: Basically, using our own immune system to attack and destroy cancer.
Brilliantly written, it weaves history, scientific research and accidental discoveries that have led to major victories against the “Emperor of All Maladies”!
The book discusses B-cells, T-cells, killer T-cells, CAR-T cells, monoclonal antibodies and many of the elements of our immune system involved in this fight. Really enjoyed reading it!
