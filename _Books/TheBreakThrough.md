title:  "The Breakthrough: Immunotherapy And The Race To Cure Cancer"
---
Just finished my 9th book on cancer: Immunotherapy has significantly accelerated over the past decade unleashing our immune systems to attack cancer. The book discusses Checkpoint Inhibitors (CTLA4, PD1/PDL1), CAR-T therapies (first FDA approval in 2017) and TILs. And, we are at the beginning of this revolution!
