title:  "Making Sense of Cancer"
---

A thought-provoking and challenging scientific philosophical book that describes the evolutionary forces (germ cells and somatic cells) at the heart of cancer.  The book argues that we are just containers for carrying genetic code - aka "The Selfish Gene". Definitely challenges convention and gives us a lot to think about wrt cancer and the quest for a cure.
